### Description
The Text-to-Speech (TTS) Converter app allows users to input text and generate corresponding audio output. The app supports multiple languages and voices, providing users with options to customize the speech synthesis according to their preferences. Users can select their preferred language, voice gender, and speech rate to create a personalized audio experience.

### Aim
The aim of the Text-to-Speech Converter app is to provide a versatile and user-friendly tool for converting written text into spoken words. The app aims to assist individuals with visual impairments, language learners, and anyone needing auditory feedback from text. By offering customization options, the app enhances the user experience and makes text-to-speech conversion more accessible and enjoyable.

### Algorithm
1. *User Input*:
    - Prompt the user to enter the text they want to convert to speech.
    - Provide options for the user to select the language of the text.
    - Provide options for the user to select the preferred voice (e.g., male or female).
    - Provide options for the user to adjust the speech rate (e.g., slow, normal, fast).

2. *Language and Voice Selection*:
    - Based on the user's selection, load the appropriate language and voice data.
    - Ensure the selected voice is compatible with the chosen language.

3. *Text-to-Speech Conversion*:

    - Apply the user's preferences for voice and speech rate during the conversion process.

4. *Audio Output*:
    - Generate the audio file in a compatible format (e.g., MP3, WAV).
    - Provide an option for the user to play the audio within the app.
    - Allow the user to download the audio file for offline use.
